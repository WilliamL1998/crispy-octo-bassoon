# 15-16 Project 2: 

# Interactive Full-Stack Project

## Description

Regarding the CSS, we use Bulma as a CSS framework. Is easy to understand and to use.
There are two ways to install it, adding the CDN link in the header of html file or install the package to node modules.
We used the first option. Finally, we build a site simple but colorful and responsive.
